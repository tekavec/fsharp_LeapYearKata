# Leap Year Kata in F&#35;

Implement a class that checks if a year is a leap year.

All the following rules must be satisfied:
- Is NOT a leap year if NOT divisible by 4
- Is a leap year if divisible by 4
- Is a leap year if divisible by 400
- Is NOT a leap year if divisible by 100 but NOT by 400

Examples:
- 1997 is NOT a leap year (not divisible by 4)
- 1996 is a leap year     (divisible by 4)
- 1600 is a leap year     (divisible by 400)
- 1800 is NOT a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400)
